junrar-android
======

Android port of my junrar fork: https://github.com/koroshiya/junrar
This port provides Android developers with a tool through which RAR decryption and extraction/manipulation is possible.

Example usage can be found on: https://github.com/koroshiya/junrar

*Note: in order to use this library, you may need to partially move the source files over to your application.
For example, in order to get the decryption working properly I needed to move the gnu, org and de package bases to the existing Android project.
